# 1. Introduction to Arceus X. 

Arceus X is a popular ROBLOX exploit, known for being the most first ROBLOX script executor on mobile. Arceus X was founded by Tiahh in Late 2021, Arceus X was later got replaced with Arceus X NEO. (NEO means NEW.)

## 1.1. System recommendations.

Before downloading Arceus X, it is recommended for the device to support arm64 and armeabi-v7a. The device must have at least 4 GB of RAM. The OS should be at least Android 10.0. If your device doesn't match with the recommendations, you're least likely to get Arceus X to work properly.

## 1.2. Downloading Arceus X.

To download Arceus X, go to https://spdmteam.com/ , scroll down and press the "Download" button. You'll be redirected to a Mediafire page, press the Download button on this page, accept the download and wait until it downloads.

## 1.3. Getting the key.

When you'll launch Arceus X client, you may come across the keysystem. To complete the keysystem, copy the link off the Arceus X client and paste it in the browser. Complete 3 gateways using either Linkvertise or LootLinks. Once completed, you wouldn't have to carry the key around, the key automatically authorizes your Hardware ID to be valid for using Arceus X.

### 1.3.1. Note.

If it seems like Linkvertise or LootLinks isn't working properly, it is not the problem with Arceus X. SPDM Team (that owns Arceus X.) doesn't own any of Linkvertise nor LootLinks. If you're having issues with one of those websites, try using VPN, because most of the causes are the cause of blocked region.

# 2. Using the Arceus X Menu.

Launching the Arceus X client, you'll come across a translucent dark bubble with Arceus X Icon drawn over it. You can drag this bubble to anywhere else, click on this bubble and you'll open the Arceus X Menu.

## 2.1. Using the script executor.

The script executor has the thread identity of Level 8. The thread identity Level 8 grants all privileges to scripts. Try typing in `printidentity()` and pressing the Execute button after. Say "/console" in the in-game chat and see the thread identity printed out on the output console.

### 2.1.1. For learning Roblox Lua.

We have links for you to learn and understand Roblox Lua, there are the links below.

Now, back to the topic.

## 2.2. Using quick hacks.

There are quick hacks available on the Arceus X menu, you can try launching scripts here, if you don't want to carry some random `loadstring`s everytime you go somewhere.

### 2.2.1. Note.

The quick hacks (Except for aimbot, fly, shiftlock and keyboard scripts.) aren't owned by SPDM Team, so if one script isn't working properly, it's not Arceus X's problem.

## 2.3. Using a script hub.

A script hub is a list of scripts, that is set by you. Script hubs are saved locally in `/storage/emulated/0/Arceus X/` directory. To save a script, copy the script's code first, then press the clipboard button and type in the script's name.

### 2.3.1. Putting scripts into auto-execute.

1. Use ZArchiver. (Install from Google Play Store, if not installed.)
2. Go to `/storage/emulated/0/Arceus X/Script Hub` directory.
3. Copy specific script file(s).
4. Drag the copy(ies) to `/storage/emulated/0/Arceus X/Autoexec` directory.

# 3. Introduction to Arceus X's script environment.

Arceus X actually has it's own script environment and many people don't actually know it. I (IvanIzWorthless) was able to find Arceus X's script environment, while playing around with `getgenv()` method.

## 3.1. Arceus X Library.

Arceus X has a global library and it's a table called `arceus`. There are small amounts of things in this library, so we gotta wait, until Arceus X Devs update the library.

### 3.1.1. Showing the toast messages.

This function shows a toast message via Arceus X.

```lua
<void>> arceus.show_toast(<string> Message)
````

Example:

```lua
arceus.show_toast("Arceus X is my favorite!")
```
